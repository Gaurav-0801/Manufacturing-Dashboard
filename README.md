#### Supplier Performance Score
\`\`\`typescript
performanceScore = (onTimeDeliveries / totalDeliveries) * 100
\`\`\`

#### Overall Performance Calculation
\`\`\`typescript
overallPerformance = 
  deliveryScore * 0.30 +     // On-time delivery weight
  qualityScore * 0.25 +      // Quality rating weight  
  costScore * 0.25 +         // Cost savings weight
  inventoryScore * 0.20      // Inventory management weight
\`\`\`

#### Cost Savings Logic
- **On-time Delivery Bonus**: 2% of shipment value
- **Late Delivery Penalty**: 5% cost impact calculation
- **Cumulative Tracking**: Running total per supplier

## üîß Configuration & Customization
